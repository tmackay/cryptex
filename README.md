Print in Place Cryptex Capsule

Simple print-in-place Cryptex using multiple rows of key teeth to allow wide-format treasure boxes. [post-processing and demo](https://youtu.be/g47d3kLQg34)

Key combination can be adjusted by jumbling the character array. Any characters may be included in any order (or duplicated). The number of digits can also be adjusted simply by adding extra rows to the character array.

A one layer gap separates a thin support area for the rings. Separate rings after printing with a sharp edge in a rolling motion. Beware of z-seam alignment, it will give the game away (use random).

UPDATE (v1.5) - More security enhancements. False gates, false teeth, a degree of shim protection and provision for magnets to prevent gravity tensioning (I've been watching @LockPickingLwyr). It's still plastic, though. Some more cosmetic options included.

UPDATE (v1.6) - Add a riddle and a twist.
